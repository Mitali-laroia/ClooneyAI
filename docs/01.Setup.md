# Setup Guide

This document outlines the steps to set up the Clooney AI project on your local machine.

## Initial Setup Steps

Follow these commands to initialize and set up the project:

```bash
# Initialize the project with uv
uv init

# Create a virtual environment with Python 3.13
uv venv --python 3.13

# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Sync dependencies from pyproject.toml
uv sync

# Run the setup command (see Makefile for details)
make setup
```

## Project Configuration

### pyproject.toml

The `pyproject.toml` file is the central configuration file for the project. It contains:

- **Project metadata**: Name, version, description, and author information
- **Build system**: Uses `hatchling` as the build backend
- **Dev dependencies**: Includes ruff (linter/formatter), mypy (type checker), and pytest
- **Tool configurations**: Settings for pytest, coverage, mypy, and ruff
- **Scripts**: Entry point for running the application (`app`)

Key features:
- Python 3.13+ required
- Comprehensive testing setup with pytest and coverage reporting
- Strict linting rules with ruff (with many rules enabled and specific ignores)
- Tab-based indentation for code formatting

### mypy.ini

The `mypy.ini` file configures static type checking with mypy. It enforces:

- **Python version**: Set to 3.11
- **Strict type checking**: Disallows untyped function definitions and decorators
- **Django plugin**: Configured for Django-specific type checking (though this project uses FastAPI)
- **Third-party imports**: Ignores missing type stubs for Django and Django REST framework
- **Migration/manage.py exclusions**: Skips type checking for Django-specific files

**Note**: There's a version mismatch - `mypy.ini` specifies Python 3.11, but `pyproject.toml` requires Python 3.13+. This should be aligned for consistency.

## Next Steps

After completing the setup, you can:
- Run the application: `uv run app`
- Run tests: `pytest`
- Format code: `ruff format .`
- Lint code: `ruff check .`
- Type check: `mypy src/`
